# Coffee Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting coffee sales using time series analysis and visualization tools. It provides insights into sales trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies to help businesses make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze and forecast coffee sales using ARIMA and other statistical models.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for data exploration.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
- **Customizable Filters**: Allows users to filter data by date ranges and other criteria.

## Data Source

The sales data should be a CSV file with columns such as:

- Date
- Sales
- Product Category
- Region

Ensure the data is clean and formatted correctly before use.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional forecasting models like Prophet.
- Implement real-time data updates.
